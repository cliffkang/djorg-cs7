#Deployment Experience

Going through something step by step doesn't feel very enlightening. I would have
prefered the deployment to be something where the instructor goes through explaining
why we do certain things and what problems these solutions we're using solve. I'm 
sure that Heroku has made deployment easier, but I don't know why. Yeah, and just in
general, don't really understand why we're doing certain things in our sprint today.

So, I'm just looking forward to the solution lecture, where I hope we get some of this
information instead of spending hours in documentation :).

I got to deployment and the site is working as it did locally.
