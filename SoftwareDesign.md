#Objective-oriented

Passing characteristics down is an interesting paradigm to work with and definitely
saw the usefulness of it with character design. But it just feels really similar to
using components in React, where you find reusable code and then build off of that.

It's kind of like how if there's any repeated code, you can create a function to call,
which that repeated code whenever you need it. On a very micro level, whenever I use
some function or method more than once, I'll put it into a variable, especially if
the method call is kind of long. This way, I can make my code a bit more succinct and readable.
